# Optimization frameworks in matlab
## 1 - CVX
### 1 - 1 - What kind of problems can cvx solve?
[Before using cvx tool, read this first!](http://ask.cvxr.com/t/why-isnt-cvx-accepting-my-model-read-this-first/570)
CVX is specifically designed for certain kinds of convex optimization problems, as well as certain mixed-integer convex models and geometric programs. If you do not already know that your problem fits into one of CVXâ€™s supported problem classes, then CVX is not the correct tool to use. All in all, there are in general three kinds of problems can be addressed by CVX tool:
+ certain kinds of convex problems,
+ certain kinds of mixed-integer models,
+ geometric programs.
### 1 - 2 - The procedures of using CVX.
First, check the convexity of your model. Second, express your model in terms of these [functions](http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/funcref.html) and avoid [DCP errors](http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/dcp.html).
See [quick start](http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/quickstart.html) for more information.
## 2 - YALMIP
[YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) is a modeling framework in MATLAB that supports both convex and non-convex problems, and it connects to a wider variety of solvers than CVX. So that might be worth a try if you want to stay in MATLAB. And of course, MATLAB has an optimization toolbox of its own.
